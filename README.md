# midnight-cli
high-performance security audit cli for solo builders

**overview**

midnight-cli is a terminal-based command-line companion for solo developers and founders who juggle multiple tasks and late-night coding sessions. think of it as a silent co-founder watching over your code, spotting critical risks, and giving you clear, actionable advice before you ship.

whether you’re doing a final prelaunch check, deep production audit, or a quick single-file scan, midnight audit helps you ship smarter and safer. without needing a team or expensive tools.


**features**

**three audit modes:**

**1.	prelaunch audit**
scan your entire codebase before merging or deploying. detect security issues, missing infrastructure checks, and high-risk patterns.
	
**2.	production audit**
deep dive into your code, database patterns, server compatibility, and dependencies. perfect for validating production readiness.

**3.	quick scan**
scan individual files while coding. instant feedback on high-risk lines, unsafe patterns, or insecure dependencies.


**key benefits**

•	prioritized actionable advice: focus on the most critical fixes first.

•	clean terminal output: color-coded risk reports (🔴 critical, 🟡 medium, 🟢 safe).
	
•	modular & extensible: add scanners or ai-assisted fixes in the future.

•	local-first: run entirely on your machine 

•	peace of mind: know that your code is launch-ready even if you’re working solo.
