# midnight-cli
_high-performance security audit cli for solo builders_

**overview**

_midnight-cli is a terminal-based command-line companion for solo developers and founders who juggle multiple tasks and late-night coding sessions. think of it as a silent co-founder watching over your code, spotting critical risks, and giving you clear, actionable advice before you ship._

_whether you’re doing a final prelaunch check, deep production audit, or a quick single-file scan, midnight audit helps you ship smarter and safer. without needing a team or expensive tools._


**features**

**three audit modes:**

**1.	prelaunch audit:**

_scan your entire codebase before merging or deploying. detect security issues, missing infrastructure checks, and high-risk patterns._
	
**2.	production audit:**

_deep dive into your code, database patterns, server compatibility, and dependencies. perfect for validating production readiness._

**3.	quick scan:**

_scan individual files while coding. instant feedback on high-risk lines, unsafe patterns, or insecure dependencies._


**key benefits**

•	prioritized actionable advice: focus on the most critical fixes first.

•	clean terminal output: color-coded risk reports (🔴 critical, 🟡 medium, 🟢 safe).
	
•	modular & extensible: add scanners or ai-assisted fixes in the future.

•	local-first: run entirely on your machine 

•	peace of mind: know that your code is launch-ready even if you’re working solo.

**tech stack**
	•	language: go (fast, lightweight, perfect for cli tools)
	•	architecture: modular, local-first, future-ready for optional ai-assisted fixes
	•	scan engine: rule-based checks for security, infrastructure, and production hygiene
	•	output: prioritized, color-coded terminal reports with confidence scores


**why midnight audit?**

solo founders and indie developers don’t have teams to double-check every line of code. midnight audit gives you:
	•	confidence before deploying
	•	speed when shipping features
	•	clarity on what actually matters

it’s your late-night wingman, helping you avoid embarrassing bugs, security mishaps, or production failures — all from your terminal.

**roadmap**
	•	phase 1: local cli mvp with 10–15 high-impact checks
	•	phase 2: optional cloud ai for fix suggestions and heavier scans
	•	phase 3: subscription version with risk history, ci integration, and team features
